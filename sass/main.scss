/* All elements will have no padding or margin */
/* The box-sizing property defines how the width and height of an element are calculated: should they include padding and borders, or not. */
/*   box-sizing: border-box === border and padding are no longer added to element */
/* box sizing inherited from body tag which we have set as border box allowing height and width to include padding as a part of total */
/* applying default style for pseudo elements too because * tag wont do it for pseudo */

/* default font size is 16px set by browser, to set it 10px we use percenatge because then user can zoom in out to inc dec font so 10/16*100  */
/* so below 1 rem is 10px because we set font-size as 10px in html tag, by default it is 16px */




/* block elements acquire entire width and give a line break so we use that for arranging header at center *//* animation name is the keyframe animation name we created */
/* animation duration.. the time it takes to complete the animation */
/* animation delay is after how much time the animation starts */
/*  */


/* header will  occupy 95% of the viewport size*/
/* The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. */
/* The background-size property specifies the size of the background images. */
/* There are four different syntaxes you can use with this property: the keyword syntax 
("auto", "cover" and "contain"), the one-value syntax (sets the width of the image (height becomes "auto"), 
the two-value syntax (first value: width of the image, second value: height), and the multiple background syntax 
(separated with comma). */
/* animation name is the keyframe animation name we created */
/* animation duration.. the time it takes to complete the animation */
/* animation delay is after how much time the animation starts */
/*  */

/* keyframes are used for animation */
/*  0% is the initial state 100% is the final state */
/* so at initail state we want content to be hidden hence opacity is 0 and at final state we want it be completely visible */
/* remember that elements come from the left */
/* transform x means moving from righ  to left and if minus then opposite and transform y means top to bottom and minus means opposite */


/* Best way to algin a div horiz and vert inside another div */
/* position is absolute in relation to parent element, parent should have position:relative for this to work */

/* NOTE:: You should also note that, if an absolutely positioned element is not a descendant of a positioned 
(be it absolute, fixed, relative or sticky) element then its positions are set relative to the viewport. */
